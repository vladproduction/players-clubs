This updatePlayer method can handle both full and partial updates, offering flexibility for clients.
PUT requests, ensure that you always validate all fields before updating;
PATCH requests, only provide fields to update.

Key Considerations:

*Partial Updates:
The method checks each field to decide whether to update them, accommodating for PATCH-like behavior where
not all fields need to be updated.
Default values (like 0 for integers) are typically used to check if a field was provided.
Depending on DTO design, might consider using Integer instead of int or add more robust checks.

*Club Association:
If the Club information is updated, it verifies if the club exists before setting the reference in the Player.

*Error Handling:
An PlayerNotExistException/ClubDoesNotExistException is thrown if the player or club is not found.

Mapping DTOs:
Used third-partial library (mapstruct) to mapping entity into dto and vise versa
